          <h2>The Benefits Of Eating Blueberries</h2>
          <p>
            Blueberries consist of 14% carbohydrates, 0.7% protein, 0.3% fat and
            84% water (table). They contain only negligible amounts of
            micronutrients, with moderate levels (relative to respective Daily
            Values) (DV) of the essential dietary mineral manganese, vitamin C,
            vitamin K and dietary fiber (table). Generally, nutrient contents of
            blueberries are a low percentage of the DV (table). A 100-gram
            serving provides a relatively low amount of food energy – 240

          <h2>Blueberries In Israel</h2>
          <p>
            Growing blueberries in Israel is not considered natural. Blueberries
            grow in the wild in the northern part of the planet and in order to
            thrive, its species need cold rations (varies by species). But the
            truth is that blueberries need strong and direct sun, and do not
            only grow in very cold climates. Certain varieties known as
            "southern varieties" also thrive in Israel in the central region of
            the country and the Sharon region.
